<h3>My Japanese learning journal</h1>
    <p>Hello to whoever is reading this, I'm going to write about my Japanese learning journey in this blog post. All
        blog entries are from my MAL account
        <br>
        DD/MM/YY btw<br>
        <br><br><u> 31/10/22 </u> - I currently know all N5 kanji and a fraction of N4, Current manga volumes read in
        Japanese -
        6
        (mainly Yotsubato)

        <br><br><u>5/11/22</u> - Here's a picture of all the Japanese manga I've read so far, ordered left to right from
        least
        difficult to most. I've also been doing some Anki flashcards for the past month and a bit. An N4 kanji deck and
        an overall kanji deck, I've probably learnt the same number of kanji I would of in 6 months in about 1 from
        revising flashcards everyday (I revise around 100 a day which take ~10 min.


        <br> <br><u>22/11/22</u> - I had my Japanese exam yesterday (year 10), it was pretty easy. It was mainly reading
        comprehension
        and an essay to write at the end. I hope to get a high mark (I got 98% on the last exam).

        <br> <br> <u>3/12/22</u> - Hello everyone, I just got my exam result back yesterday with 97%, I got 21/20 on the
        essay
        writing
        sections because I guess mine was really a high standard lol.

        <br> <br> <u>6/12/22</u> - I've been making some powerpoints on content we learn in class which I show to my
        classmates,
        they are
        fun to make
    </p>
